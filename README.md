#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
    
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software
    It is important to the technology industry because it is efficient, scalable, and can be maintained
    it also reduces failed instances through testing
    It also helps teams work together through processes like Agile or DevOps

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    1. The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), 
    2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, 
    3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    Planning – Defining project goals, estimating resources, and creating a roadmap.
    Requirement Analysis – Gather and document what the software must do.
    Design – Create system architecture, UI design, and database structure.
    Development (Coding) – Write the actual code based on design specifications.
    Testing – Identify and fix bugs to ensure the software works correctly.
    Deployment – Release the software to users or clients.
    Maintenance – Provide updates, fix issues, and improve functionality over time

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    1. In terms of approach, waterfall is sequential and step-by-step while Agile is iterative and flexible
    2. In waterfall each phase happens one after the other while in agile work is partitioned into smaller cycles with continuous feedback
    3. Waterfall is rigid in that changes are difficult once development starts while agile is highly adaptable since requirements can change anytime
    4. Waterfall has minimal customer involvement since they see the final product while in agile customers provide feedback throughout the process
    5. waterfall takes longer while agile is faster since working versions are released frequently
    6. In waterfall testing is done at the end while in agile it is done throughout the development

   Waterfall would be ideal for projects where requirements are clear and unlikely to change while agile would be best for fast-changing environments where feedback is key 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    1. Software developer- writes and maintains code on the project requirements
    2. Quality assurance engineer -  ensures software meets quality standards before release
    3. Project manager - oversees the entire development process and keeps the team on the task
   

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in software development. Give examples of each.
    -An IDE is a software application that provides tools to help developers write, test, and debug code efficiently. E.g VS Code, PyCharm, Eclipse. They assist in code editing, debugging, compiling interpretation, and auto-completion
    -A Version Control System (VCS) tracks code changes, allowing multiple developers to collaborate and manage different project versions. E.g. Git and Subversion. They assist in branching and merging, committing history and collaboration


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    1. Debugging- this can be a challenging task, especially in a huge codebase
    To counter this use debugging tools, write unit tests to catch issues early, and finally break down the problem into portions to work with.
    2. Meeting deadlines - the pressure to deliver on time can lead to low-quality software and burnout
    To counter this use the agile method, break down tasks, and communicate realistic deadlines.
    3. security and breaches - cyber threats and vulnerabilities can put software at risk
    To counter this follow secure coding practices, update dependencies and pentest units


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    1. unit testing- testing individual components in isolation with tools like JUnit, and PyTest. 
    This catches small errors early making debugging easier
    2. Integration testing- testing how different services work together with tools like Postman
    This detects data flow and compatibility issues between modules
    3. system testing - tests the entire application
        This helps identify problems before real users interact with it
    4. Acceptance testing - the final testing before deployment and is done by users
    This helps confirm that the software is ready for release

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

    It enhances AI accuracy and relevance
    It improves efficiency and
    Optimizes AI for specific use cases


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    Vague- Tell me about bicycles
    Improved- Compare electric and manual bicycles in terms of cost, speed, effort required, and maintenance.
    The second prompt is more effective because it is:
        clear and specific- compares manual and electric
        concise and detailed- specifies cost, speed and maintenance cost
        guide Ai for better out put
